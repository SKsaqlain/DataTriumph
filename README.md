Market basket analysis is based upon the identiﬁcation and analysis of purchasing patterns of the customers it helps in scientiﬁc decision support for retail market by mining association rules among items people purchased together. Mining purchasing patterns allows retailers to adjust promotions, store settings and serve consumers better.The process involves an analysis of historic data and based on that analysis to predict the future occurrences or events.In this paper we have proposed multiple model usig k-nn,SVM, MLP to test whether can supervised learning algorithmn can be used to recommend items to users and also implemented a model that would predict whether the item will be reordered or not, using logisticregression algorithm which was also testted witha NN model to check which model performed better and and also a recommending system that will recommend products to customer based on collaborative ﬁltering and using the products which have been re-ordered multiple times that is high demand. 


<ul><li>PROPOSED APPROACH:-</li></ul>
As most of the approaches uses Associative rules mining and Apriori based methods thus majority of the time is consumed in generating the rules.
